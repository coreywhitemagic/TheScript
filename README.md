# 🎭 The Script

The Script is a simple C++ program that helps you memorize any script. It uses basic AI-style fuzzy matching to check how close your input is to the original line, so you don’t have to worry about typos or exact wording.

🧠 How It Works

Run the program with one of the included text files:

script.exe astrology.txt

You'll be prompted to type each line from the file, one at a time.

If your input is close enough, you’ll move to the next line.

If it’s wrong, retype the line or restart from the beginning.
