Your heart line is strong and clear
This means you will lead a good life, wnd be fairly happy
A heart line that curves like this means
It's easy for you to express your feelings
Your head line curves towards the wrist
This means you are creative
A straighter line would make you more down to earth
Your life line shows how much energy you have
It comes across the palm
Which means you are someone with plenty of stamina and energy
Not everyone has a destiny line
It indicates a solid direction and Path in life
Does that make sense?
