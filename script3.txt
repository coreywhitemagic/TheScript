You can handle the challenges ahead  
So don't doubt yourself  
Rely on your intuition  
Although it won't always be easy to hear  
You already know the answers  
But you need to think realistically  
Have the courage to express yourself  
And make your own decisions  
You know what you need to do  
But be careful moving forward  
Your higher power will guide you  
And you've felt this happening before  
Learn how to listen  
And understand it is not always your fault  
Take care of your responsibilities  
And focus on what you need to do  
Don't give up on your dreams  
And you can still make them happen  
There are opportunities in the future  
But it may be a challenge to see them  
Finish what you are doing  
And you will have time for the rest later  
You may not understand why yet  
But you have an important purpose in life 
And it will become clear as time goes on
Do you understand?
